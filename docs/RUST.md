# Agent Guidelines for Rust Code Quality

This document provides guidelines for maintaining high-quality Rust code. These rules MUST be followed by all AI coding agents and contributors.

## Your Core Principles

All code you write MUST be fully optimized.

"Fully optimized" includes:

- maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime
- using parallelization and SIMD where appropriate
- following proper style conventions for Rust (e.g., maximizing code reuse (DRY))
- no extra code beyond what is necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e., no technical debt)

Before completing a task, perform an additional optimization pass to verify the code meets these standards. If optimization opportunities remain, address them before handing off to the user.

## Preferred Tools

- Use `cargo` for project management, building, and dependency management.
- Use `serde` with `serde_json` for JSON serialization/deserialization.
- Use `axum` for creating any web servers or HTTP APIs.
    - Keep request handlers async, returning `Result<Response, AppError>` to centralize error handling.
    - Use layered extractors and shared state structs instead of global mutable data.
    - Add `tower` middleware (timeouts, tracing, compression) for observability and resilience.
    - Offload CPU-bound work to `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` or background services to avoid blocking the reactor.
- When reporting errors to the console, use `tracing::error!` or `log::error!` instead of `println!`.

## Code Style and Formatting

- **MUST** follow Rust API Guidelines and idiomatic Rust conventions
- **MUST** use four spaces for indentation (never tabs)
- **NEVER** use emoji, or Unicode that emulates emoji (e.g., ✓, ✗). The only exception is when writing tests and testing the impact of multibyte characters.
- Use snake_case for functions/variables/modules, PascalCase for types/traits, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Limit line length to 100 characters (rustfmt default)
- Assume the user is a Python expert, but a Rust novice. Include additional code comments around Rust-specific nuances that a Python developer may not recognize.

### Naming
- **Names** of functions, structs, methods, constants, and variables **MUST** give an unambiguous understanding of their responsibility.
- Name by responsibility and subject, not by the current implementation detail (key, mechanism, storage) — the detail can change and the name would then lie. Disambiguate similar things by subject, not by mechanism.
- An implementation detail belongs in a name only where it is literally that thing's responsibility at its layer
- **Functions and methods MUST be `verb_object`** — a verb (the action) plus the noun it acts on. **NEVER** name a function with a bare adjective, participle, or state word: there is no object and the call site is unreadable. Banned: `ensure_staged`, `rebuild_stale`, `validate_inner`. Good: `stage_commits`, `load_root`, `write_table_metadata`. Constructors keep Rust convention: `new`, `with_<thing>`, `from_<source>`, `try_<verb>`.
- **The verb MUST NOT lie about behavior.** Do not say `rebuild` when the first call builds, nor carry `stale`/`inline`/`tmp` when that is not the contract.
- **Variables, arguments, and fields MUST be nouns** naming what the value *is* — the type is already in the signature, so the name carries meaning, not the type. An adjective is allowed **only** as a qualifier on a noun (`pending_commits`), **never** standalone. Banned as standalone names: `pending`, `staged`, `current`, `data`, `val`, `tmp`. Collections take a plural noun: `commits`, `tables`.
- **Booleans MUST read as predicates:** `is_active`, `has_descendants`, `should_retry`.
- **No abbreviations** except domain-canonical ones (`id`, `uri`, `cas`). The same concept MUST share one name across the codebase; different concepts MUST NOT share a name (do not call it `commits` here and `pending` there).
- **Acid test:** the name MUST be understandable at the call site without reading the body. `self.stage_commits(&mut commits, &root)` shows both the action (`stage`) and the object (`commits`). If it does not, rename it.

## Documentation

- **MUST** give every public item a doc comment stating its contract; a method whose body is self-evident needs one line, not a paragraph
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
- Include examples in doc comments for complex functions

### Comment why, not what

- A comment MUST add what the code cannot state itself: the reason for a decision, a non-obvious invariant or contract, a trap, a cross-reference.
- **NEVER** restate the body in prose. If deleting the comment loses no information a reader couldn't get from the code, delete it.
- **Acid test:** a good comment answers a question that arises *after* reading the code. One that answers "what does this line do" is noise — remove it.
- A shared mechanism is documented **once** at its definition; call sites that use it MUST NOT repeat the explanation (link to it if needed).
- A doc comment on a `pub` item states the **contract** (guarantees, errors, invariants), not a trace of the implementation. `# Arguments`/`# Returns` blocks are required only when a name or signature is genuinely ambiguous; do not pad self-evident params.

Example doc comment:

````rust
/// Calculate the total cost of items including tax.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `items` - Slice of item structs with price fields
/// * `tax_rate` - Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Total cost including tax
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `CalculationError::EmptyItems` if items is empty
/// Returns `CalculationError::InvalidTaxRate` if tax_rate is negative
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let items = vec![Item { price: 10.0 }, Item { price: 20.0 }];
/// let total = calculate_total(&items, 0.08)?;
/// assert_eq!(total, 32.40);
/// ```
pub fn calculate_total(items: &[Item], tax_rate: f64) -> Result<f64, CalculationError> {
````

## Type System

- **MUST** leverage Rust's type system to prevent bugs at compile time
- **NEVER** use `.unwrap()` in library code; use `.expect()` only for invariant violations with a descriptive message
- **MUST** use meaningful custom error types with `thiserror`
- Use newtypes to distinguish semantically different values of the same underlying type
- Prefer `Option<T>` over sentinel values

## Error Handling

- **NEVER** use `.unwrap()` in production code paths
- **MUST** use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
- **MUST** use `thiserror` for defining error types and `anyhow` for application-level errors
- **MUST** propagate errors with `?` operator where appropriate
- Provide meaningful error messages with context using `.context()` from `anyhow`
- **NEVER** use `panic!`; **MUST** propagate errors to the caller via `Result`

## Function Design

- **MUST** keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- **MUST** prefer borrowing (`&T`, `&mut T`) over ownership when possible
- Limit function parameters to 5 or fewer; use a config struct for more
- Return early to reduce nesting
- Use iterators and combinators over explicit loops where clearer

## Struct and Enum Design

- **MUST** keep types focused on a single responsibility
- **MUST** derive common traits: `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq` where appropriate
- **MUST** group the declaration of the structure and its implementation
- Use `#[derive(Default)]` when a sensible default exists
- Prefer composition to inheritance-like patterns
- Use builder pattern for complex struct construction
- Make fields private by default; provide accessor methods when needed

## Testing

All new and modified tests **MUST** follow the project testing policy in
[docs/tests.md](docs/tests.md).

- **NEVER** add production methods or widen production visibility solely for tests.
  Test-only helpers and fakes belong in `#[cfg(test)]` modules, integration-test support, or
  a deliberate testing feature and should implement production traits where applicable.
- Keep inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules at the end of the source file.

## Imports and Dependencies

- **MUST** avoid wildcard imports (`use module::*`) except for preludes, test modules (`use super::*`), and prelude re-exports
- **MUST** document dependencies in `Cargo.toml` with version constraints
- Use `cargo` for dependency management
- Organize imports: standard library, external crates, local modules
- Use `rustfmt` to automate import formatting

## Rust Best Practices

- **NEVER** use `unsafe` unless absolutely necessary; document safety invariants when used
- **MUST** call `.clone()` explicitly on non-`Copy` types; avoid hidden clones in closures and iterators
- **MUST** use pattern matching exhaustively; avoid catch-all `_` patterns when possible
- **MUST** use `format!` macro for string formatting
- Use iterators and iterator adapters over manual loops
- Use `enumerate()` instead of manual counter variables
- Prefer `if let` and `while let` for single-pattern matching

## Memory and Performance

- **MUST** avoid unnecessary allocations; prefer `&str` over `String` when possible
- **MUST** use `Cow<'_, str>` when ownership is conditionally needed
- Use `Vec::with_capacity()` when the size is known
- Prefer stack allocation over heap when appropriate
- Use `Arc` and `Rc` judiciously; prefer borrowing

## Concurrency

- **MUST** use `Send` and `Sync` bounds appropriately
- **MUST** prefer `tokio` for async runtime in async applications
- Avoid `Mutex` when `RwLock` or lock-free alternatives are appropriate
- Use channels (`mpsc`, `crossbeam`) for message passing

## Security

- **NEVER** store secrets, API keys, or passwords in code. Only store them in `.env`.
    - Ensure `.env` is declared in `.gitignore`.
- **MUST** use environment variables for sensitive configuration via `dotenvy` or `std::env`
- **NEVER** log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)

## Version Control

- **MUST** write clear, descriptive commit messages
- **NEVER** commit commented-out code; delete it
- **NEVER** commit debug `println!` statements or `dbg!` macros
- **NEVER** commit credentials or sensitive data

## Tools

- **MUST** use `rustfmt` for code formatting
- **MUST** use `clippy` for linting and follow its suggestions
- **MUST** ensure code compiles with no warnings (use `-D warnings` flag in CI, not `#![deny(warnings)]` in source)
- Use `cargo` for building, testing, and dependency management
- Use `cargo test` for running tests
- Use `cargo doc` for generating documentation

## Before Committing

- [ ] All tests pass (`make test`)
- [ ] No compiler warnings (`make check`)
- [ ] Clippy passes (`make clippy`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`make fmt`)
- [ ] All CI checks pass (`make ci` runs check, fmt, clippy, and test)
- [ ] All public items have doc comments
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials

**Remember:** Prioritize clarity and maintainability over cleverness.
